# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This AI/ML project applies K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on their Age and Annual Income, enabling targeted marketing strategies. The project includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Elbow Method for optimal cluster selection, and clear visualizations.

## 📊 Features
- EDA with distribution plots and correlation heatmap
- K-Means clustering with optimal k selection via Elbow Method
- Cluster visualization and centroids plotting
- Summary statistics for each cluster

## 📁 Project Structure
- `customer_segmentation_kmeans.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the complete implementation
- `Customers.csv` - Sample dataset (or dummy data)
- `images/` - Output plot images
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
